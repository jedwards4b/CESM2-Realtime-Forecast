#1::  add 'MCB_mask' as a monthly output variable for the atm component? This is an output variable 
specified by the MCB_mask.F90 SourceMod and is the easiest way for me to see if the mask is being implemented in the correct months.

#2:: Jack helped me modify one of the SourceMods files (MCB_mask.F90) to allow us to turn on MCB for the first year (2019) 
but off the subsequent years to allow the possible ENSO event to develop. This file also points to the version of the 
MCB mask that we want to use for August initializations in the SE Subtropical Pacific. This version of the file can be 
found here: /glade/work/jesswan/scripps/NCAR-ECIP/mask_CESM/SourceMods_sample/SMYLE_sample.

#3:: The last thing we may want to change is another SourceMods file (micro_mg2_0.F90) that specifies the 
magnitude of the MCB perturbation. Currently, this file is increasing the CDNC to 375 #/cm3, but we may want to 
start with a stronger perturbation to get a signal, closer to 500 #/cm3. I've modified this file and put it in the 
same directory as in #3. You should be able to copy all the files in this directory to /SourceMods/src.cam for your case.
