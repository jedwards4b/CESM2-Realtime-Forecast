Hi all,

I have created the new MCB seeding masks and source mod files for the next round of simulations. This next set of 
ensembles should all be May initialized for both the 15/16 and 97/98 El Ni√±o.

Nan-- see below for the source mod directories for each of the new experiments. The last two sets of numbers in the 
directory name indicate the months MCB will be turned on in the first two years of the simulations. Since MCB is on for 
parts of the first and second simulation years for the "All in" and "Last effort" experiments, I had to add an 
extra if-statement in MCB_mask.F90. It might be worth running just 1 ensemble member for each of these 7 new experiments 
just to make sure that the modification is working correctly before running all members, but I leave that decision to you. 
Let me know if you have any questions!

15/16 El Nino (3x10 ensemble members):
"All in" (MCB on 06-2015 to 02-2016): /glade/work/jesswan/scripps/SMYLE-MCB/mask_CESM/SourceMods_ElNino_2015-2016/MCB_2015-05_06-02
"Linearity hypothesis" (MCB on 07-2015 to 12-2015): /glade/work/jesswan/scripps/SMYLE-MCB/mask_CESM/SourceMods_ElNino_2015-2016/MCB_2015-05_07-12
"Last effort" (MCB on 11-2015 to 02-2016): /glade/work/jesswan/scripps/SMYLE-MCB/mask_CESM/SourceMods_ElNino_2015-2016/MCB_2015-05_11-02

97/98 El Nino (4x10 ensemble members):
Default May initialization (MCB on 07-2015-09-2015): /glade/work/jesswan/scripps/SMYLE-MCB/mask_CESM/SourceMods_ElNino_1997-1998/MCB_1997-05
