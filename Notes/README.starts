I may have gotten mixed up in one of my earlier emails, but the plan for SMYLE is to do 
1970-2019 start dates, not 1958-2019. The extension backwards in time is something to 
consider in the future. If you have been running prior to 1970, please keep them but 
do not continue performing them. The priority therefore is:

Stage 1: November starts:
  1.1  1970-2019 mbrs 1-10
  1.2  1970-2019 mbrs 11-20

Stage 2:  Remainder of all start dates (1970-2019)
