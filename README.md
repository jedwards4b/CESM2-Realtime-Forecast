The tools in this repository are designed to facilitate hindcasting with CESM2.
The repository has several branches, each branch is run for a different project. 

This project is focused on Marine Cloud brightening
Investigators: John Fasullo, Jessica Wan

Marine cloud brightening (MCB) has been proposed as a way to cool the Earth by injecting 
sea salt in the lower atmosphere to form brighter marine clouds. MCB has a particular advantage of 
being amenable to regional applications since it would be deployed in the troposphere and have a 
shorter atmospheric lifetime than other solar geoengineering proposals. Recent work on the 2019-2020 
Australian wildfires suggests that regional cloud brightening may also play an important role in 
modifying climate variability. Biomass burning aerosols were transported across the South Pacific 
and “naturally” brightened the Southeast Subtropical Pacific (SESP) stratocumulus cloud deck, ultimately 
triggering a series of responses that have been linked to a multiyear La Niña event (Fasullo et al., 2023). 

Using the Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE) with the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2), we 
simulate MCB in the SESP region to explore the efficacy of MCB to modify El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). 
We run a series of seasonal ensembles with varying durations of MCB deployment initialized prior to major 
historical ENSO events: (1) the 2019-2020 La Niña event to replicate the results of Fasullo et al. (2023) 
and (2) the 1997-1998 and 2015-2016 El Niño events to test MCB’s potential efficacy in weakening El Niño. 
These experiments are illustrative examples and serve as a starting point to test the robustness of MCB’s 
ability to influence ENSO.
